<h3>Almond Milk</h3>

<p>Almond milk is a delicious and healthier alternative to soy and cow milk. It's easy to make and very delicious. The
longer you soak the almonds, the creamier the milk turns out.</p>

    <li>1 cup raw almonds</li>
    <li>water to cover</li>
    <li>3 cups water</li>
    <li>1 tbsp agave nectar</li>
    <li>pinch sea salt</li>
</ul>


<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>Place almonds in a bowl and pour in enough water to cover; soak at least 12 hours. Drain water.</p>
<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>Blend almonds and 3 cups water in a blender on low speed for 10 seconds. Turn blender off for 5 seconds. Blend almonds
and water on high speed for 60 seconds. Pour mixture through cheesecloth or a nut bag into a bowl. Discard the pulp or
save for another use.</p>
<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>Clean the blender and return milk to blender; add agave nectar and salt. Blend milk until smooth.</p>
