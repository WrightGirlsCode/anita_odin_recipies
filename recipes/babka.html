<h3>What is Babka?</h3>
<p>
  Babka is a dense cake, although it looks a little like a bread. It's a sweet
  yeast dough filled with fudgy chocolate or cinnamon in layers and baked. It
  also sometimes has a streusel on top.
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>For the dough:</p>
<ul>
  <li>¾ cup milk</li>
  <li>¼ cup butter</li>
  <li>2 cups bread flour</li>
  <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
  <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
  <li>1 cup water (Optional)</li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>

<h2>For the chocolate filling:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>5 (1 ounce) squares semisweet</li>
  <li>chocolate, finely chopped</li>
  <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
  <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
  <li>¼ cup butter, chilled</li>
</ul>

<h2>For the streusel:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>¼ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
  <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>¼ cup butter, chilled</li>
  <li>1 egg beaten with 1 tsp water</li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Directions</b></h2>

<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>
  Warm the milk and melt 1/4 cup butter in a glass or ceramic bowl in the
  microwave for 30 seconds, or on the stovetop in a saucepan. Combine the bread
  flour, 2 cups all-purpose flour, yeast, and 1/4 cup sugar. Add the water, the
  milk-butter mixture, the egg, and the salt to the dry ingredients and mix
  well.
</p>

<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>
  Use the dough hook in a stand mixer on low speed or knead the dough by hand
  until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 15 minutes. If the dough is too
  wet, add more bread flour, about 2 tablespoonfuls at a time (up to 8
  tablespoons) to make a workable dough; too much flour can make the dough dry.
  Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let rise until double in size, about 1
  to 1 1/2 hours.
</p>

<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>
  Make the chocolate filling and the streusel while the dough is rising. For the
  filling, stir together the finely chopped chocolate, the cinnamon, and 1/4 cup
  sugar. Cut in 1/4 cup chilled butter with a fork. To make the streusel,
  combine the confectioners' sugar and 1/4 cup all-purpose flour; cut in 1/4 cup
  chilled butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
</p>

<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p>
  When the dough has doubled, punch the dough down and cut it into two equal
  pieces. Loosely shape each piece into a ball. Cover the dough with a damp
  cloth and let it rest for 10 minutes.
</p>

<h3>Step 5</h3>
<p>
  Roll out one portion on a lightly floured surface to form a 15x4-inch
  rectangle. Sprinkle with half the chocolate filling, roll up to form a long
  log, and seal the seam. Attach the ends to form a circle and place the ring,
  seam-side down, on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the second
  piece of dough. Use a serrated knife or kitchen shears to cut slits at 1-inch
  intervals around the rings. Cover the rings with damp kitchen towels and let
  rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.
</p>

<h3>Step 6</h3>
<p>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>

<h3>Step 7</h3>
<p>
  Brush the loaves with the egg wash, if desired. Sprinkle streusel on top. Bake
  the loaves for about 25 minutes, rotating the baking sheets to promote even
  browning, until the bread is a deep golden brown.
